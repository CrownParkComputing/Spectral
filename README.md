# Spectral <img src="src/img/noto_1f47b.png" width="5%" height="5%" />
Sinclair ZX Spectrum emulator from the 80s.

## About
Spectral is an experimental emulator that I have been randomly assembling [since the pandemic days](https://twitter.com/r_rlyeh/status/1280964279903158273), inspired by my old fZX32 emulator.
Hardcore ZX users will find little value in this emulator right now, but I hope newbies may find its ease of use somehow appealing to try.
That being said, Spectral has a very compatible TAP/TZX loader and some other interesting features that provide me some fun in these days.
Code is highly experimental and prone to change in the future. I will keep altering/breaking things randomly for good sake.
